Intro the Game Web Tech Repository
Hi, my name is Winson.

I am a second year Game Design and Development student here at RIT. I am from Hanover, Pennsylvania. 
In my past I have had experience with programming in a few languages along with a minor experience with robots.
I also love working with either 2D or 3D designing and animations. I'm a fan of playing all kinds of video games and watching animes ever since I was little.
